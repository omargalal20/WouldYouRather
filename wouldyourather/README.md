# Would You Rather (Second project from the Advanced Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program)

A web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

# App Functionality

When a poll is clicked on the home page, the following is shown:

Text “Would You Rather”;
Avatar of the user who posted the polling question; and
Two options.
For answered polls, each of the two options contains the following:

Text of the option;
Number of people who voted for that option; and
Percentage of people who voted for that option.

The form for posting new polling questions should be available at the /add route. The application should show the text “Would You Rather” and have a form for creating two options. Upon submitting the form, a new poll should be created, the user should be taken to the home page, and the new polling question should appear in the correct category on the home page.

Each polling question should link to the details of that poll. The details of each poll should be available at 'questions/:question_id'.
